We believe in a transparent and open-source peer to peer process. We think that the contributors who take time to review and push code, test new features, write documentation, translate to other languages and spread the word are the key to project success. We would like to use this opportunity to salute all the contributors who have contributed this project. We wouln't have come this far without your help and support. Thank you, Let's make this world a better place.
